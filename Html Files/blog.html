         <h4 class="text-center">About History of Veterinary</h4>
         <p class="blog"> Ancient Indian sage and veterinary physician Shalihotra (mythological estimate c. 2350 BCE), the son of a sage, Hayagosha, is considered the founder of veterinary sciences.
             Claude Bourgelat established the earliest veterinary college in Lyon in 1761.
             The first veterinary college was founded in Lyon, France in 1762 by Claude Bourgelat. According to Lupton, after observing the devastation being caused by cattle plague to the French herds, Bourgelat devoted his time to seeking out a remedy. This resulted in his founding a veterinary college in Lyon in 1761, from which establishment he dispatched students to combat the disease; in a short time, the plague was stayed and the health of stock restored, through the assistance rendered to agriculture by veterinary science and art.
             The Odiham Agricultural Society helped establish the veterinary profession in England.
             The Odiham Agricultural Society was founded in 1783 in England to promote agriculture and industry, and played an important role in the foundation of the veterinary profession in Britain. A 1785 Society meeting resolved to "promote the study of Farriery upon rational scientific principles."
             The professionalization of the veterinary trade was finally achieved in 1790, through the campaigning of Granville Penn, who persuaded the Frenchman Benoit Vial de St. Bel to accept the professorship of the newly established Veterinary College in London. The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons was established by royal charter in 1844.
             Veterinary science came of age in the late 19th century, with notable contributions from Sir John McFadyean, credited by many as having been the founder of modern Veterinary research.

  <h4 id = "Afador">Afador</h4><p class="blog">
    The Afador is a mixed breed dog–a cross between the Afghan Hound and Labrador Retriever dog breeds. Loyal, energetic, and affectionate, these pups inherited some of the best qualities from both of their parents.
    Afadors are also sometimes known as the Afghan Lab. You can find these mixed breed dogs in shelters and breed specific rescues, so remember to always adopt! Don’t shop if you’re looking to add an Afador to your home!
    Afadors make excellent family pets, although they do better with older children and seasoned dog owners who can give the breed the training and attention they require. Afadors also make for good guard dogs, and they’re alert to strangers. The mixed breed is very energetic and athletic, so access to a safe outdoor space is preferred.
    See <a href = "https://dogtime.com/dog-breeds/afador">this</a> for all Afador facts and mixed dog breed characteristics!</p>
    <h4 id = "Akbash"> Akbash</h4><p class="blog">
    The Akbash is a rare, purebred dog from the country of Turkey. Loyal, alert, and intelligent, these pups have some of the best qualities you could ask for.
    These pooches go by several other names, including Coban Kopegi, Akbaş Çoban Köpeği, and Askbash Dog. Despite their status as a rare breed, you may find these purebred dogs at local shelters or rescues. Remember it’s always better to adopt and not shop!
    These amazing pups are very protective of their families and have strong guarding instincts. They’re big dogs and better suited for larger homes with yards or near open areas where they can roam around. They’re fiercely independent but love to be around their human family. Akbashes are great with children but need early socialization if they’ll live with other dogs or pets in the home. If you want a protective and loyal dog who will love you unconditionally, then the Akbash may be right for you!

    <h4 id="Golden">Golden Retriever</h4><p class="blog">
    The Golden Retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the U.S. The breed’s friendly, tolerant attitude makes them fabulous family pets, and their intelligence makes them highly capable working dogs.
    Golden Retrievers excel at retrieving game for hunters, tracking, sniffing out contraband for law enforcement, and as therapy and assistance dogs. They’re also natural athletes, and do well in dog sports such as agility and competitive obedience.
    These dogs are fairly easy to train and get along in just about any home or family. They’re great with kids and very protective of their humans. If you want a loyal, loving, and intelligent companion, consider adopting a Golden Retriever into your pack.

    Best known as the star of Disney’s 101 Dalmatians, this sleek and athletic dog breed has a history that goes back several hundred years. He started out as a coach dog but has also served in many other capacities, including hunter, firehouse dog, and circus performer. As charming in life as in film, he goes from gallant to goofy to gallant again in the blink of an eye, and loves to be a part of everything his family does.

    <h4 id ="Setter"> English Setter</h4><p class="blog"> <p class="blog">
    The English Setter dog breed was named for its practice of “setting,” or crouching low, when it found birds so the hunter could throw his net over them. After the development of the gun, the dog was developed so he would stand in the more traditional Pointer style. The English Setter is still used as a hunting dog today as well as a family companion.

    <h4 id = "Shepherd">German Shepherd</h4> <p class="blog">
    The German Shepherd Dog is one of America’s most popular dog breeds—for good reason.
    They’re intelligent and capable working dogs. Their devotion and courage are unmatched. And they’re amazingly versatile, excelling at most anything they’re trained to do: guide and assistance work for the handicapped, police and military service, herding, search and rescue, drug detection, competitive obedience, and–last but not least–faithful companion.

    The Labrador Retriever was bred to be both a friendly companion and a useful working dog breed. Historically, they earned their keep as a fisherman’s helper: hauling nets, fetching ropes, and retrieving fish from the chilly North Atlantic.
    Today’s Lab is as good-natured and hardworking as their ancestors, and they’re also America’s most popular breed. Modern Labs work as retrievers for hunters, assistance dogs, show competitors, and search and rescue dogs, among other canine jobs.

    <h4 id ="DeerHound">DeerHound</h4> <p class="blog">
    The original purpose of Scottish Deerhound dog breed was to hunt and bring down the Scottish roe deer, a magnificent beast twice or more their size. Today, if the Scottish Deerhound were writing a personals ad, he’d say that he enjoys long walks, opportunities to run, regular meals, and a nice sofa to nap on.

    <h4 id="Great_Dane">Great Dane</h4><p>
    Oh, baby! A Great Dane is truly a great dog breed–large and noble, commonly referred to as a gentle giant or as the “Apollo of dogs.” Apollo is the Greek god of the sun, the brightest fixture in the sky.

    Great Danes have been around for a long time, and depictions of Dane-like dogs on artifacts date back thousands of years. Although this is a pure breed of dog, you may find them in shelters and rescues, so remember to adopt! Don’t shop if you decide this is the dog for you.
    Great Danes certainly hold stature in the dog world; but though they look terribly imposing, in reality they’re one of the best-natured dogs around. For all of their size, Great Danes are sweet, affectionate pets. They love to play and are gentle with children.
    DogTime recommends this big, spacious crate to give your big Great Dane a place to rest and relax. You should also pick up this dog brush and massager for your short-haired pup!

    The Aegean is a great family cat, with their social disposition credited to their history as one of the oldest ever domestic cat breeds around.

    <p class="blog">
        It is recognised by the British Rabbit Council; however it is not recognised by the American Rabbit Breeders Association.
        The Alaska rabbit was created in 1900 by Max Fischer, of Gotha, and Schmidt, of Langensalza. They crossed Havanas, Dutch, Himalayans and Champagne d'Argents with the goal of obtaining a rabbit that looks like the Alaskan fox, which would be profitable in the fur trades of that time. They did not achieve this goal, and instead ended up with the black Alaska that is known today. These black Alaskans were first shown in 1907, and imported to North America in the 1970s by Bert Reurs of Canada. They were added into the American Rabbit Breeders Standard, but removed in 1981 after little interest in the breed developed.
        The Alaska rabbit weighs 7-9 lbs. It is considered a Normal Fur breed by British Rabbit Council standards, and only comes in its standard, pitch black color. The Alaska Rabbit Club is the BRC's national specialty club for this breed

    <h4 id = "Paint_Horse">American Paint Horse</h4>
    <p class="blog">The American Paint Horse is a breed of horse that combines both the conformational characteristics of a western stock horse with a pinto spotting pattern of white and dark coat colors. Developed from a base of spotted horses with Quarter Horse and Thoroughbred bloodlines, the American Paint Horse Association (APHA) breed registry is now one of the largest in North America. The registry allows some non-spotted animals to be registered as "Solid Paint Bred" and considers the American Paint Horse to be a horse breed with distinct characteristics, not merely a color breed.
